# uare-research-trajectory-control

This repository is part of an academic research project focused on **trajectory control for UAVs (drones)** in simulated environments using **ROS 2** and **Gazebo Classic**. It builds upon the open-source [`sjtu_drone`](https://github.com/NovoG93/sjtu_drone) simulator and adds custom controllers, improved dynamics, and additional functionality for research in navigation and control.

## üìå Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate, control, and evaluate various UAV trajectory tracking algorithms. Key contributions include:

- Altitude PID controller for real-time height regulation.
- Target point navigation using full 3D PID.
- Circular trajectory controller with multi-phase logic.
- Polygonal trajectory controller supporting smooth transitions.
- Modified launch and configuration files.
- Integration with ROS 2 topics for takeoff, landing, and velocity control.
- Realistic drone behavior via Gazebo with simulated sensors (IMU, GPS, camera, sonar).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

- ROS 2 Humble (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Gazebo Classic (Gazebo 11)
- `sjtu_drone` simulator (required as base)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository into your ROS 2 workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/uare-research-trajectory-control.git
```

2. Clone the required base simulator:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NovoG93/sjtu_drone.git
```

3. Install dependencies and build:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## üß™ Usage

To launch the simulation with your custom controller:

```bash
ros2 launch uare_research_trajectory_control drone_control.launch.py
```

Takeoff:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /drone/takeoff std_msgs/msg/Empty '{}' --once
```

Land:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /drone/land std_msgs/msg/Empty '{}' --once
```

## üìä Implemented Controllers

### Altitude Control

A dedicated node (`altitude_controller.py`) uses a PID loop to maintain a target altitude, configurable in real time using the ROS 2 parameter `target_altitude`.

### Point-To-Target PID Navigation

The `point_to_achieve_v1.py` node allows 3D navigation to any specified target using PID on yaw, altitude, and forward velocity. It adjusts orientation first, then advances while maintaining stability.

### Circular Trajectory Tracking

The `circular_trajectory_PID_v2.py` node implements a two-phase controller: approach to the circle and circular movement using dynamic angular updates, with real-time odometry.

### Polygonal Trajectory Navigation

`points_to_achieve_v1`

The `.py` node performs sequential waypoint tracking across a polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.) using simple proportional control for yaw, altitude, and velocity.

### Smooth Polygonal Navigation

The `points_to_achieve_v3_smooth.py` node adds smoothed transitions between polygon corners using a radius-based switching mechanism to avoid sharp turns and ensure continuous movement.
